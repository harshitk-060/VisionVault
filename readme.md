# ImageProfiler

ImageProfiler is a Python library designed to offer in-depth analysis and reporting for image datasets. Inspired by the functionality of libraries such as pandas-profiling but focused on image data, ImageProfiler provides intuitive tools to extract meaningful insights from images, making it an essential tool for data scientists, researchers, and developers working in image processing, computer vision, and related fields.

from imageprofiler import ImageProfiler

# Load your image dataset
images_path = "/path/to/your/images"

# Initialize the profiler
profiler = ImageProfiler(images_path)




## Installation

You can install ImageProfiler using pip:

```bash
pip install imageprofiler
```
